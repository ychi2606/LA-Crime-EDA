# LA Crime Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the City of Angels! Los Angeles, known for its vibrant culture, entertainment industry, and sunny weather, also faces challenges related to crime. 
As part of efforts to ensure public safety, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has provided a dataset containing detailed information about reported crimes in the city. 
This project is my work from Datacamp Competition.

'DR_NO': Division of Records Number
'Date Rptd': Date reported (MM/DD/YYYY)
'DATE OCC': Date of occurrence (MM/DD/YYYY)
'TIME OCC': Time of occurrence (24-hour military time)
'AREA': LAPD Geographic Area (1-21)
'AREA NAME': Name designation of Geographic Area
'Rpt Dist No': Reporting District Number
'Crm Cd': Crime code
'Crm Cd Desc': Description of the crime
'Vict Age': Victim's age (years)
'Vict Sex': Victim's sex
'Vict Descent': Victim's descent
'Premis Cd': Premises code

## Objective
Examine how crime varies by area, crime type, victim age, time of day, and victim descent.
Build machine learning models to predict criminal activities, such as when a crime may occur, what type of crime, or where, based on features in the dataset.
Visualize the distribution of crimes on a map to identify high-crime areas.
